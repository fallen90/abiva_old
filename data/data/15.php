	<li>A <font  color='#004058'>pronoun</font> is a word that takes the place of a <font  color='#004058'>noun</font>
	<li><font  color='#004058'>Object pronouns</font> are pronouns that come after either verbs or prepositions.
	<li>The words <font  color='#004058'>them, us, me, her,</font> and <font  color='#004058'>him</font> are <font color='#004058'>object pronouns</font>.</li>

	<li>The words <font c color='#004058'>to</font> and <font  color='#004058'>with</font> are <font  color='#004058'>prepositions</font>.</li>
