									• A pronoun that takes the place of the subject of the sentence is called <i>subject pronoun</i>.<br>
									• The subject is the one being talked about in the sentence.<br>
									• The pronouns <i>I, she, he, we, they, you</i> and <i>it</i> are subject pronouns.<br>
									Examples:<br>
									• My father and I went to a farm in Batangas. We were happy to see the place.<br>
									The word 'we' took the place of the words 'my father and I' <br>
									• The farm was in perfect peace. It was such a wonderful place.<br>
									The word 'it' took the place of the word farm. <br>
									• Mang Jose, a farmer, owned the nipa hut. He also owned a vast plantation of vegetables. <br>
									  The word 'he' took the place of the name 'Mang Jose'.<br>
									• Mother could not join us in the trip. She missed seeing the lovely place.<br>
									  The word 'she' took the place of the word 'mother'.<br>
									Example:<br>
									• Father and Mother like farms and plantations. They dream of living in a farm when they get old.<br>
									  The word they took the place of the words father and mother.<br>
									• Bernadette is my name. I wrote about my first visit to a farm.'",
